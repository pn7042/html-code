    The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom or Britain,
    is a sovereign country located off the north-western coast of the European mainland. The United Kingdom 
    includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller 
    islands.[16] Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land border with another 
    sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the United Kingdom is surrounded by 
    the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east, the English Channel to the south and the Celtic Sea to 
    the south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain
    and Ireland. The United Kingdom's 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi) were home to an estimated 66.0 
    million inhabitants in 2017.
    The United Kingdom is a unitary parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy.[17][18] The current
    monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, who has reigned since 1952, making her the world's longest-serving current 
    head of state.[19] The United Kingdom's capital and largest city is London, a global city and financial 
    centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million.[20] Other major cities include Birmingham, Manchester
    , Glasgow, Leeds and Liverpool.
