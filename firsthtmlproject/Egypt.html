    Egypt is the most populated country in the Middle East, and the third most populous on the African continent, with about 95 million inhabitants as of 2017.
    Its population grew rapidly from 1970 to 2010 due to medical advances and increases in agricultural productivity[218] enabled by the Green Revolution.Egypt's
    population was estimated at 3 million when Napoleon invaded the country in 1798.Egypt's people are highly urbanised, being concentrated along the Nile (notably
    Cairo and Alexandria), in the Delta and near the Suez Canal. Egyptians are divided demographically into those who live in the major urban centres and the fellahin,
     or farmers, that reside in rural villages. The total inhabited area constitutes only 77,041 kmÂ², putting the physiological density at over 1,200 people per km2, similar to Bangladesh.
