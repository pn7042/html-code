    Switzerland occupies the crossroads of Germanic and Romance Europe, as reflected in its four main linguistic 
    and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Although the majority of the population are 
    German-speaking, Swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values 
    such as federalism and direct democracy,[11] and Alpine symbolism.[12][13] Due to its linguistic 
    diversity, Switzerland is known by a variety of native names: Schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (German);[note 5] 
    Suisse [sɥis(ə)] (French); Svizzera [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and Svizra [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (Romansh).
    On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helvetica – frequently shortened to "Helvetia" – is used instead of the four national languages.

    Switzerland is one of the most developed countries in the world, with the highest nominal wealth per adult[14]
    and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product.[15][16] It ranks at or near the top in several international
    metrics, including economic competitiveness and human development. Zürich, Geneva and Basel have been ranked among 
    the top ten cities in the world in terms of quality of life, with Zürich ranked second globally.
