Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia,is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and 
numerous smaller islands. It is the largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New 
Guinea, Indonesia, and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. The population of 25 
million[6] is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. 
The country's other major metropolitan areas are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide.

Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years prior to European discovery[14] with the arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th 
century, who named it New Holland. In 1770, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the 
colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788, a date which became Australia's national day. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the 
time of an 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the 
six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as 
a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories.
